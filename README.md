Reflection:
    My first javascript progam is in the bag.  THe most important lessons I learned were regarding
    functions, parameters and scope, basically block scope and global.  I learned about those things in reading, but they didn't really sink in until I was using them to solve problems.  Which leads me to believe that PROBLEMS = LEARNING.
